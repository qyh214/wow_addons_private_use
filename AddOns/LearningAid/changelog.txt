# 1.12a5

Talents that override existing spells, like Strangulate/Asphyxiate now
work correctly.

Retalenting spam filter is working, and now does not display redundant
entries for spells that are unlearned and then immediately relearned
when Summarize is selected.

Ignore list is still broken. Do not use.

SpellAPI is more comprehensive and robust.

Deleted a lot of old, commented-out code from previous expansions.

# 1.12a4

Mangle is working.
Flyouts are working.
/la search is working.
Ignore list is broken. Do not use.

# 1.12a3

Actually fixed the issue with spec-specific spells appearing in /la search
results whether or not they were on an action bar, for reals this time.

Added new object-oriented SpellAPI.lua, which may become an independent
library at some point.

Pulled out a lot of obsolete code that has succumbed to bitrot.
There's still a lot left.

Known Issue: If you change specs, all the spec-specific spells for the
spec you didn't start the current game session in will appear. Probably
not that difficult to fix, but it's late and I want to get something at
least semi-functional out tonight.

# 1.12a2

Fixed the issue with spec-specific spells breaking /la search
[Update: Did not actually fix the issue with spec-specific spells]

The "Find Shapeshift forms" toggle was backwards.  Fixed.

New Ignore Ability function.  Ctrl-click on an icon in the Learning Aid

/la unignoreall to reset the list of ignored abilities

When the option "Show Learn/Unlearn Messages" is set to "Summarize",
spells that are unlearned and immediately relearned while swapping
talent specs are not printed to the chat log.

# 1.07 Completed Features

When the player unlearns a spell or ability due to a talent reset,
remember where on the player's action bars that spell or ability was.
When the spell or ability is relearned, put it back on the player's
action bar in the same place, as long as that slot is empty.

Same as above, but due to a server-side talent reset.

Remember multiple sets of unlearned ability to action bar button
mappings.

Filter "You have learned" and "You have unlearned" spam down to two
lines, saying "You have unlearned A, B, C." and "You have learned X, Y,
Z."

names, such as "Swipe (Bear)".

# Possible

Rewrite entire spell learn / unlearn system to use the system chat
message event instead of caching and diffing.
