Bugs:

# 2015-06-23: Patch 6.2.0 release day

Spam filter is busted. No messages show regardless of setting.
INCORRECT: There is no more spam when changing specs! HALLELUJAH

# 2015-01-05

Ignore list savedvariables code mismatch with ignore list update code. Need to reconcile and possibly
update data format number and update UpgradeIgnoreList to handle the old to new conversion
Make a copy of saved variables files before doing that!

Find Missing Actions is borked for Monks, again.

RFE: Global option to automatically ignore auto attack / auto shot

# 2014

Error when learning warlock talent grimoire of service (extra temp demons)
  which brings up a button with the flyout
  then unlearning the talent
  then mousing over the button

FIXED, MUST VERIFY "Asphyxiate", a talent override, has the wrong name, "Strangulate" in the LA popup.

FIXED change remaining instances of .globalID, .specID and .slot to ._gid, ._sid and ._slot respectively

Flyouts: Tricky cases
Don't have flyout, do have all flyout spells
  *do nothing*? show flyout?
Don't have flyout, have some but not all spells
  show flyout? show missing spells? *show both*?
Don't have flyout, have no spells
  show flyout? show spells? *show both*?
Have flyout, have some but not all spells
  show missing spells? / *do nothing*?

Flyouts: Easy cases
Have flyout, have no spells
  do nothing
Have flyout, have all spells
  do nothing

Should BookID[slot], GlobalID[gid] and FlyoutID[fid] cache their results?
  Issue: Slot may change when the spellbook updates
  Check for and update changed instances?
  Wipe BookID and refresh each update? Won't generate garbage if the contents are still cached in GlobalID
  Consequences of stale slot info:
    spell or flyout that was in slot and now either is not in any slot or is in different slot: bad

### WoW 5.0.4 / Mists of Pandaria Changes ###

The pet/mount UI has changed so much, and putting pets/mounts on action bars
seems so antiquated when people have hundreds of pets and use addons to manage
them, and pet/mount support in Learning Aid is so buggy that I have removed pet
and mount support.

API changes

New event: PLAYER_SPECIALIZATION_CHANGED fires at the end of the spec swap process

Event changed: LEARNED_SPELL_IN_TAB, global spell id (integer), tab (integer, index 1)

### Learning Aid 1.12 / 2.0 Redesign Work ###

Top down:

1. Show an icon when the player learns an ability AND the ability is not already on their action bar AND they haven't chosen to ignore that ability

  * Detect when an ability is learned
    * Scanning the spellbook
    * Watching events
    * Chat filter
  * Decide whether or not it is "new enough" to display
    * Has it been learned before?
    * Is it on an action bar already?
  * Determine whether the user wants to see it
    * Is it on the ignore list?
    * What does the ignore list really mean?
      * Class abilities
        * Ignore this ability regardless of class
        * Ignore this ability for this class only
        * Ignore this ability for this character only
      * Tradeskill abilities
        * Ignore this ability for all characters
        * Ignore this ability for this character
        * Ignore all ranks of this ability or just this rank
      * Guild abilities
        * Ignore for all characters
        * Ignore for this guild
        * Ignore for this character


### IN PROGRESS ###

got an error while learning Master Riding on the 4.2.0 PTR

test learning pet talents re: spam filter -- NOT WORKING
test unlearning pet talents re: spam filter

clicking a "/usetalents 2" macro while the retalent cast is going on fires a spurious UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED_QUIET which fools LA into thinking the talent swap was cancelled

printing newly learned stuff isn't getting triggered, like I just learned Journeyman Mining and the message didn't appear until way way later, after I spent a talent point.
  Same for learning class skills from a trainer -- passes through unmolested
  Learning talents seems to be working

filter tradeskills
  "You have learned how to create a new item: <item>."

AddButton cannot handle flyouts yet

Spam filter: Spells learned from quests?

Learn All does not properly detect when the player's character does not have enough money to buy everything


### DESIGN BLAH ###

51296 = GM cooking
3413 = Expert cooking

spells learned and unlearned
name, link, id -- player spells/abilities

name -- pet spells/abilities

I want to print them out in order

I want to remove stuff that is unlearned then relearned

pets r ez, table.insert(petLearned, name)

--spellsLearned.index[i] = id
spellsLearned.name[id] = name
--spellsLearned.id[i] = id
spellsLearned.link[id] = link

OR

spellsLearned[i] = link -- link contains both id and name

for id, name in pairs(spellsUnlearned.name) do
  if spellsLearned.name[id] then
    spellsLearned.name[id] = nil
    spellsLearned.link[id] = nil
    spellsUnlearned.name[id] = nil
    spellsUnlearned.link[id] = nil
  end
end

later...

I have three data items: id, name, link
I want to de-dupe on id
I want to sort on name
I want to print link

lua sucks

### NEW DESIGN FOR SPELL INFO CACHE ###

part the first: spell info database
  indexed by global id
  invariant information
    spell name
    spell link
    --spell icon -- probably not needed?
    is spell passive?
    possibly whether spell has class/racial/tradeskill/talent/guild origin
    type: tracking (irrelevant, no longer in spellbook, delete option), aura/presence/shapeshift/aspect/stance/form, totem
    is on a flyout?

part the second: spellbook cache
  indexed by spellbook id
    is spell known?
    global id

part the third: spam filter cache
  newly learned
    indexed by id
    sort table (by name)
  newly unlearned
    indexed by id
    sort table (by name)

part the fourth: action bar cache?

### STUFF WHAT IS DONE ###

Stack overflow due to infinite recursion in UpdateIgnoreList -- FIXED IN 1.11.2

figure out how to handle non-class abilities (like mining, herbing, skinning) with the ignore feature, which currently stores ignore information by class -- FIXED IN 1.11.1

rapidly learning multiple pets: first pet (mr chilly) did not show up, subsequent pets (mini thor, core hound pup, warbot) did -- FIXED in 1.11.1

Horked up real good from dropping AceEvent -- FIXED in 1.11.1

fix spam filter for spells with the same name (cat mangle and bear mangle) -- done

fix find missing spells for new cache layout -- done

test unlearning talents re: spam filter -- done

what's going on with call pet? -- DiffSpellBook wasn't handling flyouts correctly

spell_update_cooldown probably not going to work as end signal for retalenting (what if it fires while casting the retalent spell?) instead of player_talent_update
fixed, using unit_spellcast_stop
