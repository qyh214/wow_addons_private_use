# Adventure Guide Lockouts
Adventure Guide Lockouts is a lightweight utility add-on that tracks instance lockouts in the Adventure Guide.

The add-on displays small flags next to the buttons of saved instances. Each difficulty of an instance will have a dedicated flag, displaying details such as available and killed bosses. Tracking is also available for world bosses and LFR.

The add-on allows players to check lockouts at a glance by placing information that is inconvenient to reach to a frequently accessed interface panel. This information is especially useful when deciding which group to join in the Premade Groups tool or when farming transmog in legacy content.
