LibResInfo-1.0
=================

Library to provide information about resurrections cast in your group.

LibResInfo detects resurrection spell casts and identifies who they are
being cast on, and provides that information to addons through callbacks
and API functions. It also supports Mass Resurrection and Soulstone.

LibResInfo was written to replace LibResComm. It works locally without
the need for addon communication, so it is not necessary for anyone else
in your group to have it installed.

Requires [LibStub] [1] and [CallbackHandler-1.0] [2].

If you are reporting a bug, please include directions I can follow to
reproduce the bug, whether it still happens when all other addons are
disabled, and the exact text of the related error message (if any) from
[Bugger](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23144-Bugger.html).

If you need to contact me privately, you can send me a private message
on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.
