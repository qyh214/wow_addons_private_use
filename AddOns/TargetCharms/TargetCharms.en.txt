********************
I - OVERVIEW
********************
TargetCharms allows you to place a floating frame for easy and quick
access to assigning charms/raid icons to targets.  The series of buttons are 
highly customizable.  The user can display charms/raid icons in whatever 
arrangement and order you desire, as well as change the frame's opacity, 
location, and size. A movable "Ready Check" button and world markers/flare menu
makes it great for raid leaders!

To move icons or "Ready Check" button, right-click and drag them.  They must be set
to draggable in the setup menu to allow this.  You can ctrl+right-click the frames
to bring up the setup menu. To move the world markers you will need to go into setup and 
click "Move Markers".  The first button will turn into a green square that will be
draggable.

********************
II - SHOW OPTIONS
********************

Auto - You should probably set the show value to this if you are going to use the menu.
	It will automatically show the menus when you are able to use them. The only
	exception is that it will hide the charms/raid icons buttons when solo.

Show - Will force the menu to always be shown even when not usable.

Hide - Will hide the menu.
