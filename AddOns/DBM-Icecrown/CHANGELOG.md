# <DBM> Icecrown Citadel

## [r291](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WotLK/tree/r291) (2020-01-14)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WotLK/compare/r290...r291)

- Toc Bump for 8.3  
- Fine tuned onyxia sounds to be more scarce (removed the P2 dots loop) and more aggressively unschedule on phases to prevent sounds from previous phase continuing to play. This should improve the overall experience of funny sounds to maintain their great impact but not feel annoying/overdone.
