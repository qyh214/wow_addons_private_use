	- Omega via svn r14093: Add debug, for more video analysis
	- Omega via svn r14092: Change the mannoroth add spawn fix around a bit to more cleanly ignore the odd add spawns that sometimes spawn during phase transitions but before new phase timers begin for them. Also fixed a bug where the backup slower phase trigger might start two infernal timers by mistake.
	- nbluewiz via svn r14091: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r14090: Fix fel flames swap warning not working on gorefiend. Reduce spam of doom spike swap warning on mannoroth Small tweak to imp timers on xhul
	- ebmor via svn r14089: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r14088: cleanup locals
	- Omega via svn r14087: #Archimond Update *Apparently focused chaos IS in combat log, it was just another spell filtered by transcriptors over zealous filter. This cleans up some annoying and slow hacks and allows me to enable the count finally. *Added phase announces so it?\226?\128?\153s more clear when they?\226?\128?\153ve started. *Only show the AI timer message on mythic. other modes don?\226?\128?\153t use any AI timers *Demonic feedback changed from pre warn only to both a pre warn and cast warning, since the cd is so variable and it?\226?\128?\153s important to know the cast has happened too so you can regroup. *Clean ups
	- Omega via svn r14086: Add personal countdown for slam fading for tanks, useful for using heroic leap or something to perfectly time clearing it between casts.
	- Omega via svn r14085: Enable 10min berserk for kilrogg, if it?\226?\128?\153s 10 min in LFR, it?\226?\128?\153s got to be at least 10 min in other modes too
	- Omega via svn r14084: bw version
	- Omega via svn r14083: This does not need a function Also, sync adds since yell range can cause missed warnings, especially during split. mythic add spawns using yells as triggers will require this, if i eventually do them.
	- Omega via svn r14082: Always show Burst warning, even if you are no where near it or not affected by it, still need to know it happened. Removed a bunch of non working timers from iron reaver mythic. Added volatilebomb cd bar for ground phase mythic Fixed unstable orb timers, they were nerfed significantly since i last looked at them. Removed redundant variable resets on pull that are already reset by ground phase trigger.
	- Omega via svn r14081: Remove useless warning from assault Adjust vehicle timers some. They are so highly variable though no timers are ever going to actually be accurate :\ They spawn faster the more dps you have.
	- Omega via svn r14080: Don?\226?\128?\153t use getspellinfo stupidly where it?\226?\128?\153s not needed

	- Omega via svn r14078: Update xhulhorac mythic timers
	- Omega via svn r14077: bw version
	- Omega via svn r14076: Add note to mythic mannoroth that the mod is simply not functional without trancriptor log.
	- Omega via svn r14075: Add font flags to timer bars
	- Omega via svn r14074: Apply inferno hack to phase 3 mannoroth as well. Same crap. sometimes a delayed spawn from previous phase can still get off during transition and mess up count/timers for next phase, so these late spawns must be ignored to ensure timer accuracy rest of fight. re-watched two of my videos and tweaked first imp spawn by 0.5 seconds. added void spawn timers as well. should be precise to the spawn. lined timers up perfectly with name plates becoming first visible.
	- Omega via svn r14073: Fix first banish timer not having count
	- Omega via svn r14072: Fix last
	- Omega via svn r14071: Filter players with digest debuff from the range frame. Hide range frame when affected by digest. Fix mythic digest timer. Add focused fire to trash mod.

	- Omega via svn r14067: CN update
	- Omega via svn r14066: Fix timer update bug
	- Omega via svn r14065: Just put spell name in local, so arg order isn?\226?\128?\153t messed up for other languages grammar
	- TOM_RUS via svn r14064: ruRU update
	- Omega via svn r14063: CN update
	- Omega via svn r14062: Small tweak to pre warning of demonic feedback.
	- Omega via svn r14061: Infoframe is going to have to wait for better logs, but at least now personal warning will also have count, by request
	- Omega via svn r14060: Fix bug that was causing Rumbling Fissure warnings/timers not to work at all on Zakuun
	- Omega via svn r14059: Push the nerfed normal/LFR timers for artillery Allow the seeds target warning (non personal one) to still show even if yells are set to free for all on Zakuun
	- Omega via svn r14058: Update valhari for mythic (only timer that seems different is onslaught)
	- Omega via svn r14057: Add iskar trash warnings finally Fix minor range frame bug on iskar fight.
	- Omega via svn r14056: Fix shared fate timer not using correct count
	- Omega via svn r14055: Fix typo that prevented hudmap for working for axe Remove add auto marking, it doesn?\226?\128?\153t work, so better to not make people think it?\226?\128?\153s a feature.
	- nbluewiz via svn r14054: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r14053: Fix archimond using wrong icon set method, might be why it was only marking one infernal Increase scan time for hellfire assault
	- Omega via svn r14052: Inc alpha
