    # Total rewrite of vectis infoframe that should greatly improve presentation of information (if it works)
    * On mythic difficulty it?\226?\128?\153s now hard coded to just show ALL names, period instead of truncating list to 8 entries
    * Unless the ?\226?\128?\156show only party?\226?\128?\157 option is enabled. lingering and vector lists are combined now. It?\226?\128?\153ll be a lingering list but if target also has vector it?\226?\128?\153ll show a special disease icon on them, what vector numbers they have, and how much time remains on their vector.
    * If show only party is enabled, infoframe will still show the vector targets in a separate target list, as it did before.
    * Infoframe now uses a table cache for lingering infection instead of UnitDebuff checks to greatly reduce UnitDebuff usage.
    
    Also, fixed some errors on Stormwall Blockade
