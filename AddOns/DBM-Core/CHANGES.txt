    Completely scrap chest timers for mythic+ dungeons. it?\226?\128?\153s buggy and clearly blizzard doesn?\226?\128?\153t provide adequate and non buggy events to really do it efficiently and I?\226?\128?\153m not going to ugly up dbms code to work around that. Use https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/mythicplustimer instead.
    Also, the objectives frame will no longer ever be hidden in mythic+ dungeons because the mythic+ temp timer has also been deleted from DBM. For same reasons as above. It?\226?\128?\153s buggy and hard to make work properly without proper detailed non buggy apis to work with. Besides this second thing was really me trying to fix bad design but often times fixing bad blizzard design often gives them an out for fixing it themselves.

    More minor fixes to mythic+ timer nonsense. probably still doesn?\226?\128?\153t cancel properly and will probably still get removed as a feature soon if blizzards game wants to keep being buggy about it.

    #Helya
    *Improved tentacle strike code so warning is slightly faster and less antispam is needed.
    *Cancel cast bar for infusion when interrupted
    *Update fury of maw timer if infusion isn?\226?\128?\153t interrupted
    *Fixed fury of maw phase 3 mythic timer. Accidentally pasted phase 2 mythic timer into phase 3 somehow.
    *Fixed phase 3 taint of sea timers not showing, the unit event doesn?\226?\128?\153t show in phase 3.
    #Guarm
    *Added optional off by default yells to the other 2 licks on guarm. I still think they are pointless but the other mod does it so i figure someone will ask for them eventually so make it an option.
    
    #random nightmare fixes
    *Fixed a voice pack bug where dark storm voice option had wrong spell id in it, causing special warning sound to still play on top of voice sound, as well as the voice option to not appear in UI.
    *Changed mark timer to be off by default on dragons since most don?\226?\128?\153t use that either. more clutter reduction. Further, there is a bug where the two dragons can sometimes desync as much as 2 seconds on applying this buff. when this happens timer ends up getting screwed up anyways.
