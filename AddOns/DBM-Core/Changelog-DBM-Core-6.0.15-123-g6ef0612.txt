	- Omega via svn r12880: Disable useless warning for now.
	- Omega via svn r12879: Hansgar and Franzok jump warnings. Added support to core for target scanner filtering by targetname. Needed by hansgar and franzok method.
	- Omega via svn r12878: add nil check to thogar targetname. i saw at least one that had bad target. (possibly died during cast)
	- Omega via svn r12877: Comment out that for now, since sometimes, it nil errors. just so users dont have to have errors while i'm still raiding and can't finish what i started there.
	- Omega via svn r12876: tweak hud update rate, 0.05 was a little sluggish. 0.04 looks better
	- nbluewiz via svn r12875: # fix train 12 bug.
	- Omega via svn r12874: Notes
	- Omega via svn r12873: Mythic Thogar update

	- Omega via svn r12871: Fix proto grenade spam on mythic (always casts 2)
	- Omega via svn r12870: Switch onupdate frame to ticker. reduces hudmap cpu usage by 50% without adversely affecting animations. tests are showing hudmap went to 0.4ms per cycle to 0.2ms per cycle when a single animation is present.
	- Omega via svn r12869: Fixes for dogs rapidly changing target like 0.04 seconds after selecting previous target
	- Omega via svn r12868: bw version
	- Omega via svn r12867: stupid.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r12866: This should fix nil error
	- Omega via svn r12865: Notes
	- TOM_RUS via svn r12864: Should be working this time
	- nbluewiz via svn r12863: # revert end Searing Plates warning for hansgar. # delay timer cancel on boat. # faster lane warning and Delayed Siege Bomb for thogar.
	- Omega via svn r12862: This should probably fix that nil
	- Omega via svn r12861: possibly fix some hud nil errors
	- Omega via svn r12860: 6 min berserk on mythic gruul as well Fix first rippling smash timer on kromog

	- Omega via svn r12857: Fix blast timer bug

	- Omega via svn r12854: Fix some durations
	- Omega via svn r12853: Revert to last working state. the refactoring had a ridiculous number of errors. every time one was fixed only found another one. It didn't seem to be registering or clearing any callbacks at all.
	- Omega via svn r12852: Actually that last fix did work
	- Omega via svn r12851: Fix a bug where it was canceling old timers too soon. It's still not fully fixed though because right now it's canceling ALL bars. which is a bug because it should only cancel bar with passed arg.
	- Omega via svn r12850: That actually wasn't issue. sometimes, it's just nil all together, not even sure how it's possible.
	- Omega via svn r12849: Strange, sometimes, DBMHudMap is nil when upvalue is created, so just avoid that issue by not creating upvalue for it. it shouldn't be nil by time it's used Hopefully fix http://prntscr.com/63o5bp Man TOM you made a mess before bed :P
	- Omega via svn r12848: Try to fix this error http://prntscr.com/63nzkp If it doesn't, i may have to temp revert callback changes so people can get through raids without so many errors.

	- Omega via svn r12808: Rearrange boss order to match progression difficulty order, vs bad dungeon journal order. LFRers will disagree with order, since LFr forces you to do first 3 in a fixed order with oregorger before gruul, but i'm sorting on difficulty order for normal+, not linear LFR order.
