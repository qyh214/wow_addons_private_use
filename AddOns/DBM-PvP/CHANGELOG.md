[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-PvP/compare/r141...r142) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-PvP/releases)

- Add Strand Of The Ancients for Wrath.  
    Add MapID for Strand of the Ancients, and create stub module for it, but don't load it (much like wintergrasp), as there's no extra functionality as of yet.
