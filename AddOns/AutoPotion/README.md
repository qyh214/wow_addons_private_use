# Auto Potion

Auto Potion was previously known as Healthstone Auto Macro. This Addon will maintain a Macro for you which uses several self healing Spells, Healthstone and Healing Potions in you Bag.

The Priority is: Player Healing Spells like (Renewal) -> Crimson Vial (disabled by default) -> Healthstone -> Highest Healing Potion in Bag
But it will prefer Healthstone over all Healing Potions.

You can also directly Keybind the Addon you find it in the Keybind Settings but you also can Move the Macro to Keybinded Button.

Which Player Healing Spells are used is configured in the Addon Settings (/ap).
I will maintain a best practise as Default but you can change the behaviour if you really want to.

## How it works:

It's actually a very basic addon which will update the given macro every time you either login or your Bag is updated. Therefore it will keep up to date if you just pick up Healthstones.

## How to use:

1. Install Addon
2. Create a empty Macro called "AutoPotion"
3. Move Macro to Button or Keybind it
4. reload
5. Profit!

## MegaMacro Compatibility

To use this addon alongside MegaMacro, you must first manually create a **Global** macro in MegaMacro, named `AutoPotion`, then `/reload` your game.
