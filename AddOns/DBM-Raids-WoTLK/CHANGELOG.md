[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WotLK/compare/r314...r315) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-WotLK/releases)

- Update RU locale and .toc file (#37)  
- Fix #36  
- remove count assumptions from penetrating cold so it doesn't fial to mark if only 4 targets get affected (which boss sometimes does). This means prioritizing icons based on raid roster index had to be scrapped, but consistent icon setting is better than sorted icons that only work sometimes.
