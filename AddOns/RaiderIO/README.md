# Raider.IO Mythic Plus, Raiding, and Recruitment

This is a companion addon to go along with the Raiding, Recruitment, and Mythic+ Rankings site, Raider.IO: https://raider.io. With this addon installed, you'll gain access to an easy way to view Mythic Keystone scores, Raid Progress, and Recruitment status for players-- all without leaving the game!

## Overview

Simply hover over a player with your mouse, your guild roster, or even the Group Finder list where you see queued people; if they meet the minimum qualifications then you'll see their score and best run in the tooltip.

![Raider.IO Tooltip Example](https://cdnassets.raider.io/images/addon/tooltip_details_20190225.png "Raider.IO Tooltip Example")

Additionally, you can right-click players from the standard target unit frame to `Copy Raider.IO URL` and then easily look up their full profile on the site. With this functionality you can directly paste these URLs anywhere on Raider.IO to navigate to that player's profile page.


## Recruitment

With the Raider.IO Recruitment features you can now also see whether a player is looking for a guild/team, or if they are recruiting for their own guild/team. This will show up as a line in the tooltip as follows:

![Raider.IO Recruitment Example](https://cdnassets.raider.io/images/addon/tooltip_details_20220227.jpg?2 "Raider.IO Recruitment Tooltip Example")

You can right click on any player that is recruiting and hit `Copy Recruitment URL` to copy a URL that you can paste into your browser to view more details of the recruitment profile.

Because recruitment information can change regularly, we encourage people to use the [Raider.IO Desktop Client](https://raider.io/addon) to keep this data in sync.

If you have run into any problems, check out our FAQ at [https://raider.io/faq](https://raider.io/faq), or join us on Discord at: [https://discord.gg/raider](https://discord.gg/raider) in `#addon-discussions` -- we always have people around willing to help.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use the RaiderIO Desktop Client: [https://raider.io/addon](https://raider.io/addon)

Once installed you can load into the game and you will start seeing Mythic+, Raiding, and Recruitment details  on players around you. This AddOn works by storing a snapshot of character data from Raider.IO and then using that to populate information on qualified players.

To qualify for inclusion in a snapshot, players must meet specific criteria based on the type of data:

**Mythic Plus**
- Have earned at least 200 points in the current or previous season. _[Honored and higher patrons](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=6788452) do not have a minimum score requirement in order to be shown in the addon._
- Have logged in to the game within the past 14 days

**Raiding**
- Have defeated at least 30% of the bosses (rounded up) in either Normal, Heroic, or Mythic

**Recruitment**
- All active and public recruitment profiles are available in-game

**Remember**: We update the addon with the latest scores and top runs **multiple times each day**. Update regularly to ensure you are seeing the freshest information. _Using the [RaiderIO Desktop Client](https://raider.io/addon) you can keep your addon updated automatically!_

## Detailed Addon Usage

Our intent with this AddOn is to provide an easy way for people to get some information at a glance when forming groups. There is no substitute for talking with your fellow players, so be a pal and listen if an applicant whispers you. These are the fields we show, and when we show them:

### Character Raid & Mythic+ Tooltips

Raid information in tooltips simply lists the best progress seen for the player.

Mythic+ tooltips have a lot of parts to them:

- `Raider.IO M+ Score`: This is the overall score for this character. If the score is from a previous season, then the value of the score is rounded to the nearest 10s, and is prefixed with `Â±`. You can also identify the previous season score by looking for the `(S#)` suffix on the tooltip headline.
- `Best Run`: This will indicate the Mythic+ level for the player's best scoring run, along with the specific dungeon. Up to three plus signs `+` will be prefixed to the keystone level to indicate how much the keystone was upgraded during that run. Note: when this keyword is highlighted green it means that the player's `Best For Dungeon` is also the same as their overall `Best Run`.
- `Best For Dungeon`: You'll see this line when using LFD to form or join a Keystone group. This will show the Mythic+ level of the player's best scoring run for the chosen dungeon.
- `Timed #+ Runs`: These lines indicate how many M+ runs have been completed by this player within the timer over the course of the current season. The player's two highest categories of Timed Runs will show by default.
- `Main's Best M+ Score` / `Main's Current M+ Score`: This indicates the best character score on this player's account, if they have [registered on Raider.IO](https://raider.io/register) and linked their Battle.Net account. This will only show if the Main's Score is greater than the current character's score. If someone has a good score on their main, then much of their prior experience will help them perform better in dungeons while on their alt.

Role icons included on Mythic+ tooltips can be thought of as badges earned by accumulating certain amounts of score while playing as that role. Fully opaque icons indicate they've earned at least 80% of their overall score in that role. Semi-transparent role icons indicate they have earned at least 40% of their overall score in that role.

### Recruitment Tooltips

We currently determine the profile to show based on a priority order for the entity and activity type. Our overall rationale is that we want the most common organized activities to take precedence when choosing what to show in-game.

1. Guild + Raiding (only recruiters)
2. Guild + Guild Mythic+ (only recruiters)
3. Team + Team Mythic+ (only recruiters)
4. Character + Raiding
5. Character + Guild Mythic+
6. Character + Team Mythic+
7. Guild + Guild PVP (only recruiters)
8. Guild + Guild Social (only recruiters)
9. Character + Guild PVP
10. Character + Guild Social

Note: Anyone in your guild who has access to the Recruitment information will show your group's recruitment profiles in-game. Meaning, it is based on the roles given to each rank. These ranks will show the tooltip in game, and will also be able to access recruitment information on the site:

- GM / Captain
- Officer
- Recruiter


### Character Profile Tooltips

You can view your personal M+ and Raid Progress profile when you open the Dungeon Finder. This will be shown as a large tooltip alongside the Dungeon Finder frame with additional details about your per-dungeon performance.

This can be used to help understand what dungeons you should try to focus on in order to raise your score.

![Raider.IO Profile](https://cdnassets.raider.io/images/addon/raiderio_profile_20190225.png "Raider.IO Profile")

By default when you are in the Dungeon Finder it will show your own profile. However, you can press a modifier key (Shift/Alt/Ctrl/Cmd) to show the target character's full profile instead. There is also a config option to invert this behavior.

### Keystone Tooltips

You can view additional details when hovering over Mythic+ Keystone items, such as:

- The highest key completed for each member of your group for the dungeon you are in, or queued for.

- `Avg. Timed +# Player Score`: This is the rounded median score of players who have successfully completed Mythic+ runs **in time** at this level. This data is sampled from the past 60 days of runs tracked on Raider.IO, and it excludes the top and bottom 1% of scores at each level. This is intended to provide a guide for the type of score you might consider when forming or joining a group based on data seen across all players.

### Group Search

You can pull up detailed information for all the characters in your group at once by utilizing the Raider.IO Group Search feature.

![Raider.IO Group Search](https://cdnassets.raider.io/images/addon/group_search_in_lfd.png "Raider.IO Group Search")

- Click the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the Dungeon Finder
- Copy the text in the window that pops up
- Go to [https://raider.io](https://raider.io) and hit Ctrl-V or Cmd-V to paste this while the site is in the foreground.

This will then take you to the Raider.IO Advanced Search page for all the characters in your group.

### Copy Character Raider.IO URL

- Click the "Copy Raider.IO URL" button
- Copy the text in the window that pops up
- Go to [https://raider.io](https://raider.io) and hit Ctrl-V or Cmd-V to paste this while the site is in the foreground.

This will take you to that character's profile page.

### In-Game Character Search (Advanced)

![Raider.IO In-Game Character Search](https://cdnassets.raider.io/images/addon/raiderio_search.png "Raider.IO In-Game Character Search")

You can look up any character in the current database by using the `/rio search` command.

When you type this, you will be presented with a small frame where you can enter the realm name and character name to search for. If they are found, then their information will be pulled up and displayed.

You can type `/rio search` to hide the window.

## Configuring the AddOn

Our recommended settings are enabled by default, but we've provided several options to customize how and where the tooltips might show while in-game. Type ``/raiderio`` to open the Raider.IO options frame. Alternatively, you can also find a shortcut in the ``Interface > AddOn`` settings frame.

Here you can easily enable or disable various features, including whether to show scores from each faction, and various tooltip customization options.

_Remember to click "Save" to save the changes, or "Cancel" to abort and close the dialog._

## Score Color Tiers

Scores map to a specific color based on their range. We've followed the standard WoW quality colors, but added additional gradients between the base values to provide more brackets to ascend through. These tiers are recalculated based on actual scores.

## Developer API

We love our fellow developers! We wanted to provide anyone in the community a simple way to tap into the scores that are a part of this addon. Addon developers can do this by utilizing the ``RaiderIO`` table to access certain APIs we provide.

If the documentation is out-of-date you can also get a lot of information straight from the source code. A lot of the functionality is annotated for the sake of the lua language server extension in vscode.

### RaiderIO.GetProfile

These functions return ``nil`` or a ``RaiderIOProfile`` table.

```
RaiderIO.GetProfile("target")
RaiderIO.GetProfile("Name", "Realm"[, region])
```

#### RaiderIOProfile

This table contains data depending on what providers are loaded. This documentation is not complete, there are several internal values but they are all based on the core data that is documented below.

RaiderIO.ProfileOutput
RaiderIO.TooltipProfileOutput
RaiderIO.DataProvider
RaiderIO.HasPlayerProfile
RaiderIO.GetPlayerProfile
