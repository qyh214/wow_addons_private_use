-- If you'd like to add a new locale, please open a pull request on the GitHub repository here: https://github.com/J141/WoW-BuyemAll-live/pulls
-- If you don't know what a pull request is or how to do it, you may also open an issue and just paste below code into the issue. I will then make sure the localisation gets included into the addon. Issues url: https://github.com/J141/WoW-BuyemAll-live/issues

if GetLocale() == "xxXX" then --change xxXX to the language code, like esES, esMX, frFR or nlNL.
	BuyEmAll.L = {
	MAX 			= "Max",
