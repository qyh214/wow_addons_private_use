-bump toc file to 9.2.5

v3.5.10
-Addon toc has been updated to WoW 9.1.0
-Fixed error that would occur when trying to purchase items that are completely free but would normally cost currency to purchase (fixing a bug that probably only happens on tournament and beta realms, where items are sometimes available for free, but blizzard does not or forgets to remove the associated currency cost info from the item)

v3.5.9
-Fixed bug that caused an error when buying a currency with another currency.

-optimized code throughout the addon for better performance and a smaller footprint

v3.5.6

-When purchasing an item that can only be bought in stacks, BuyEmAll now rounds the purchase amount up to the next multiple of the stack size the item is sold in, rather than to the nearest multiple.
This ensures you always get the amount you entered or more, and never less.
